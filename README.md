# Installation

The simplest way to install the latest release is as follows:

```shell
pip install pycite

```

To install the development version:


Open the Terminal/CMD/Git bash/shell and enter

```shell

pip install git+https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/pycite.git

# or for the less stable dev version
pip install git+https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/pycite.git@dev

```

Otherwise:

```shell
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:Nelson-Gon/pycite.git
cd pycite
python3 setup.py install

```

# Usage 

**Script Mode**

To use at the command line, please use:

```shell
python -m pycite -i testfiles/testlinks.txt -o testfiles/citations.txt
```

To get help:

```shell
python -m pycite --help
#usage: __main__.py [-h] -i INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE
#
#optional arguments:
#  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
#  -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
#                        Path to an input file
#  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
#                        Path to an output file

```

**Programming Mode**

First, one needs to create an object of class `PyCite`

```python
from pycite.pycite import PyCite
```

```python
# Need an input-output file pair 
my_citations = PyCite(input_file="testfiles/testlinks.txt", output_file="testfiles/citations.txt")
```

To generate citations, one simply calls the `cite` method.

```python
# This will write citations in the provided output file 
my_citations.cite()
```

The above gives us (only the first line is shown here). 
See [citations.txt](https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/pycite/blob/main/testfiles/citations.txt) for the full file.

```shell
Pohorille A, Wilson MA, & Shannon G (2017)  Flexible Proteins at the Origin of Life Life (Basel), 7(2),  23. 
```
